# Advent Of Code

This repository holds my code for the annual [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 
challenges. I have chosen to do these challenges in Python. 

Within this repository there are folders for every year attempted, currently these are:
- 2021
- 2022

These directories contain data folders for the challenges attempted and jupyter notebook files 
for each solved day.
